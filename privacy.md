# Privacy Policy

## What is Tsurukame?

Tsurukame is an iOS app that communicates with the WaniKani API.

## What is WaniKani?

[WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) is a Japanese Kanji learning tool.  You are required to create an account to use WaniKani.

WaniKani is not associated with Tsurukame.  [WaniKani has its own privacy policy](https://www.wanikani.com/privacy) that explains how it uses your account information.  You should read it!

## How does Tsurukame use your data?

The first time you open Tsurukame you will be asked to sign in to your WaniKani account.  When you sign in, the Tsurukame app will collect:

1. Your WaniKani username.
1. Your WaniKani level.
1. Whether you are a WaniKani paid subscriber.
1. The date you started using WaniKani.
1. Your WaniKani profile URL.
1. Your WaniKani email address.
1. Your WaniKani Public API Key (Version 2).
1. Your WaniKani HTTP cookie.

The WaniKani Public API Key and the WakiKani HTTP cookie are used exclusively to communicate with the WaniKani API, directly from your iOS device.  They are never sent to a third-party, and they are never used for any purpose other than using the WaniKani API.

Your WaniKani email address is used to fetch your Gravatar profile picture.  It is [hashed](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/hash/) before being sent to Gravatar, so if you have never created a Gravatar account Gravatar can never see your email address.  [Gravatar has its own privacy policy](https://en.gravatar.com/site/privacy).

The other information is stored securely on your iOS device and is never transmitted to a third-party.

## How does Tsurukame use your API key?

Tsurukame periodically synchronises your Kanji learning progress with your WaniKani account using the WaniKani API.

Tsurukame periodically downloads your list of upcoming reviews and lessons, and uploads your progress every time you complete a review or a lesson.

This data is stored securely on your iOS device and is never transmitted to any party other than WaniKani using the WaniKani API.
